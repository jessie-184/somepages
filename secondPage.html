		<h1>More Special Tags</h1>
		<h2>Button</h2>
		<p>Here is an example of the button tag. It is a little bit misleading since it is a button that doesn't do anything. You would want to add some interactivity, perhaps with JavaScript.
		</p>
		<button>Open</button><br>
		<button>Close</button><br>
		<hr>

		<h2>Meter</h2>
		<p>The meter tag is cool and can take a lot of attributes. But again it is better if you have some code that can make the attributes values dynamic instead of "hardcoding" them. When you think meter, think of a final score of a test.
		</p>
		<meter min = "0" max = "100" value = "50">50%</meter><br>
		<meter min = "0" max = "1" value = "0.25">25%</meter><br>
		<meter min = "5" max = "10" value = "8">60%</meter><br>
		<hr>

		<h2>iFrame</h2>
		<p>The iframe is used to nest content. It is not supported equally well by all browsers. You will want to explore setting many of the different options such as height and width.</p>
		<iframe src = "https://www.knox.edu/" width = "1200px" height = "400px%"></iframe><br>
		<hr>

		<h2>BDO</h2>
		<p>bdo stands for bidirectional override. This tag can be used to change the direction of the text.</p>
		<p>This text will go left to right.</p>
		<p><bdo dir = "rtl">This text will go right to left.</bdo></p>
